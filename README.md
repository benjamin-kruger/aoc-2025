# Advent of Code 2025 - Zig

These are my solutions to the Advent of Code problems in 2025.

I am mainly using this as an excuse to play with Zig :)

## Running the Code

I currently only have it set up to build an executable for a given day.
Run `zig build dayxx` to build the executable and then run it with `./zig-out/dayxx`.

Run the tests for a given day with `zig test src/days/dayxx.zig`.
